## Miscellaneous

When putting `Applications` in to Explorer, it will show the `Applications` folder.<br>
I need to figure out how to modify the files in this folder.<br>
As I believe this is where the `Start Menu` is stored when you click `All Apps`<br>
Sometimes Windows will leave entries in the `Start Menu` even after uninstalling the program.<br>
