This is a work in progress<br><br>
Current stable version: Not Released<br>
Current development version: 0.0.1

This project uses [CheetahUtils](http://github.com/CraigCraig/CheetahUtils)<br>

## Description
CheetahToolbox is a collection of tools mainly for Windows.<br>
It is designed to be a console application with a plugin system.<br>

Eventually, it will have a GUI using [CheetahUI](http://github.com/CraigCraig/CheetahUI).<br>
I'm currently working on the console application and plugin system.<br>

## Building
This project relies on <a href="https://github.com/GoodKittyBot">GoodKitty</a> to build and release.<br>
